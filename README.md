# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David!

In April 2024, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Math from Michigan State University.

Since my first Computer Science class in High School, I've loved building software and learning new ways to solve novel problems using software!
- Some of my interests include:
  - Compilers â€” I highly recommend reading CraftingInterpreters by Bob Nystrom to start learning about compilers
  - Theoretical Computer Science -Â **Please** check out Michael Sipser's book on this topic
  - Web applications - FullStackOpen + MDN Web Docs are two amazing resources to reference when learning to build web apps
  - Machine Learning - Read Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn for a good combination of theory and practice

I also love teaching! With 5+ years of teaching experience, I've helped many of my students, peers, and colleagues grasp challenging topics in programming, data structures, algorithms, math, and chemistry.
